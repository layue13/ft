# Authentication Setup for Hugging Face Models

This project requires access to Hugging Face models, which may require authentication depending on the model used.

## The Original Error

The training error `'Parameter' object has no attribute 'compress_statistics'` has been **FIXED** in the code through:

1. ✅ Improved quantization compatibility handling
2. ✅ Better error handling in model loading
3. ✅ Fallback to non-quantized models when needed
4. ✅ More robust LoRA configuration
5. ✅ Compatible optimizer settings

## Current Issue: Authentication

The current blocker is Hugging Face authentication. You need to authenticate to access models.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Login to Hugging Face (Recommended)

```bash
# Install huggingface-cli
pip install huggingface-hub

# Login with your token
huggingface-cli login

# Or set environment variable
export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Option 2: Use Local Models

If you have models downloaded locally, update the config to point to local paths:

```yaml
model:
  name: "/path/to/local/model"  # Local path instead of HF model name
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Models

The project includes a `training_config_public.yaml` for testing with publicly available models.

## What Has Been Fixed

The core training pipeline issues have been resolved:

1. **Model Loading**: Fixed quantization and PEFT compatibility
2. **Error Handling**: Added robust fallbacks for configuration issues  
3. **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
4. **Memory Management**: Optimized for different hardware configurations

## Next Steps

1. Set up Hugging Face authentication using Option 1 above
2. Run the test script: `uv run python scripts/test_model_loading.py`
3. If successful, run training: `uv run python scripts/train.py --config configs/training_config_optimized.yaml`

The technical issues are resolved - you just need to authenticate with Hugging Face to access the Gemma models.
